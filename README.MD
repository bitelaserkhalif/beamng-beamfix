# Fix beamng No Texture issues easily!

This application is made for **BEAMNG Drive** zipped mods in order to find what causing NO TEXTURE issues. It also can be modified to work on other file types, like jbeam.


# How to?

 1. Download from releases
 2. Double click the batch file
 3. Pin point to beamng mod folders
 4. Let it do the job
 5. Open the resultant folder in VSCode, or VSCodium (for zero tracker experience)
 6. Hit CTRL + SHIFT + F to find in all files
 7. From beamng console (tilde button default), type the missing source texture path and filename ![Look at the red errors!](https://github.com/bitelaserkhalif/beamng-beamfix/blob/master/manual_images/20231002130733_1.jpg?raw=true "Errors is Red")
 8. You can then determine the mod name (from folder name) and disable.

# Warnings!

 - At this moment, I do not check for textures.cs file (old textures type).
 - Every unpack overwrites the files on output folders.
 - Resultant could be BIG! (571 mods zipped, unpacked to 1 GB, YMMV)
